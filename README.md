# Supply Chain Dynamics

## Content of this repo
- includes the assignments during the course 
- assignments consisted of two parts; part I was an implementation of an mathematical model using mosel and part II was an simple cost analysis on an hydrogen case in Estonia  

## Overall course description
Upon completion of the course the student is able to:
1. Identify strategic, tactical and operational decisions for certain transportation and logistics problems
2. Model and assess strategic and tactical decisions
3. Understand the basic mathematical modeling techniques
4. Identify and design the right mathematical model for a proposed problem
5. Use an optimization tool and analyze/evaluate the results
6. Present the results and the final decisions in a report and show them to an audience of supply chain and logistics managers

	
Supply chains are dynamic in nature and they need to be changed and adapted to new developments, market situations and disruptions. For example, supply chains of today need to ensure that they enable the organizations to reach their sustainability goals. Typical strategic, tactical and operational decisions within a supply chain system are studied and analyzed by the use of data and quantitative methods. Mathematical modeling techniques and classical models are used to model such decision problems. Possible ways to solve such mathematical models are shown via the use of industrial solvers. The attention is put on the design and operation of supply chain systems and on the way to improve them. The student is provided with the knowledge and the tools to work with data by describing, analyzing, evaluating and making decisions based on it.
